This project involves creating a basic social network analysis tool using Python. 
The tool represents a social network as a graph, where individuals are nodes, and their relationships are edges.

The main functionalities include:

Graph Representation: The social network is modeled as a graph using nodes and edges.

Degree Centrality Calculation: The importance of each node is measured by its connections (degree centrality).

Visualization: The network is visualized to show the connections between individuals.

This tool provides a simple way to analyze and visualize social networks using Python libraries like NetworkX and Matplotlib.
